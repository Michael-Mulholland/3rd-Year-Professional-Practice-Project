							best hands. We are very happy that he was with us from morning to night. He has been capturing 
							moments throughout the day, also fun things that we didn't even get along with. He manages to 
							capture energy in his images while at the same time having a strange expression that we really 
							liked. We are happy to recommend Francis to other bridal couples!</p>

							Those sunset photos are particularly surreal - we cannot believe they are photos of us! Once

							<p>We could not have been happier with our decision to hire Francis as our wedding photographer. 
							Leading up to the wedding, we had great communication over email. He was always responsive and 
							answered any questions we had. On our wedding day, he was exactly what we needed. He was laid back 
							and fun in his interactions with us. We felt so comfortable! He was present and captured all of the 
							important moments of our wedding, but I didn’t feel like he was all up in our business (which we 
							really appreciated!) He has an eye for scouting unique photo spots and I can’t wait to see how all 
							of them turn out. Our photos so far look like a fairy tale – he somehow made us look elegant and 
							not awkward at all, which I imagine was no easy feat… my husband and I cannot recommend him enough!</p>

							<p>There are no words to describe how wonderful Francis is not only as a photographer and artist but as a 
							person. From day 1 – Francis was so genuine and kind – it felt like we’d been lifelong friends. Francis 
							photography style is so easy and natural – it’s just a joy to photograph with him. My husband, Paul and 
							I aren’t ones to take many pictures but Francis snapped the most incredible photos in the stolen moments. 
							Just after the wedding, Francis shared a preview of the photos and just with those photos – I would have 
							been over the moon happy. I’m not sure how he captured every moment but he did and for that we’re eternally 
							grateful. You can tell the care and attention he puts into the entire album. It really is the most incredible 
							gift. If Francis available – breathe a sigh of relief – because you just hit the wedding jackpot!! Best 
							decision we could have ever made. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Francis!!</p>

							<p>Francis was a delight to work with from day one! We were planning a wedding in County Louth from County 
							Mayo which is never an easy task. Francis's efficient and professional communication skills instantly 
							won us over. We didn’t meet Francis until the day of our wedding. He was well prepared and confidant 
							that it really put everyone at ease, he was a true pleasure to have around! We couldn’t be happier with 
							the way our wedding photos turned out. They are everything and more than we hoped for. We will 
							definitely be hiring him if we ever need a family photo-shoot in the future. If you are thinking of 
							hiring Francis look at his portfolio. It is a true representation of his work. He finds a way to shoot 
							each wedding in his own style, while capturing unique moments that are true to the day.</p>
