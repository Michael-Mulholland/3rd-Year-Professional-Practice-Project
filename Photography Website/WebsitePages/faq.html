							<p class="card-text card-question">How many weddings do you photograph per year?</p>
							<p class="card-text">I have decided to take a step back from how many weddings I document per year so I can truly focus on what really matters. YOU! I take on about 10 weddings a year, so I can focus on building our rapport and trust so I can create the best images for each of our couples without feeling stretched thin. Plus, I want to be there for you throughout your wedding planning process. I want to be an unlimited resource for the two of you and be completely present in all of our dealings together. This allows me to give each couple 110% attention without sacrificing the creative process and time with the people who mean the most.</p><hr><br>
							<p class="card-text card-question">How long have you been doing this for?</p>
							<p class="card-text">I have been photographing weddings for seven years. Iâ€™ve been so incredibly lucky to have photographed over 100 weddings which I feel makes me an expert on not only documenting incredible moments but in helping each of the couples along the way. I think fast on my feet, and whenever an issue arises, I are prepared to take care of it asap so you can go back to living your best wedding life.</p><hr><br>
							<p class="card-text card-question">Where are you located?</p>
							<p class="card-text">I am located in Daundalk, County Louth. However, I LOVE traveling for weddings, elopements, and sessions. I've already been to Austria, New Zealand, California, and a few other places to capture some incredible love stories and I would love to see more beautiful places and tell more incredible love stories in those spaces.</p><hr><br>
							<p class="card-text card-question">How many final images will we receive?</p>
							<p class="card-text">I hate putting a final number on anything, and I always provide more than enough images for everything that I capture. I will never hold back any images from you to meet a specific number or to make you pay for additional images. I truly believe in giving you all of the images that tell your love story in the best way possible so that 30 years from your wedding day you can still look back at your images and instantly be transported back to exactly how you felt and all of the amazing moments that you had. For those of you who love a number, however, roughly I give over 800 images for weddings and over 100 images for sessions, all edited in color and black and white.</p><hr><br>
							<p class="card-text card-question">What is your turnaround time?</p>						
							<p class="card-text">For weddings, my turnaround time is about 12 weeks, and sessions are about 6 weeks. However, I do work hard to turn around your images as quickly as possible without sacrificing the final quality.</p><hr><br>				
							<p class="card-text card-question">Can we see or purchase the RAW unedited images?</p>						
							<p class="card-text">Nope. I believe the editing truly finishes the images and gives them the look and feel that you hired me for. I will never skimp on the images that I provide you with.</p><hr><br>
							<p class="card-text card-question">How do payments work?</p>						
							<p class="card-text">I require a $500 non-refundable deposit to hold your date, and the remaining balance is due one month before your wedding. You are welcome to send in multiple payments if you would like, whatever is easiest for you works for me.</p><hr><br>
							<p class="card-text card-question">Will you photoshop our images?</p>
							<p class="card-text">I truly believe, from the bottom of my heart, that you, your loved one, and the love you share is the most beautiful thing on the face of the planet. You do not need to be photoshopped to look thinner, or have your skin look like a plastic doll. I want to give you images that truly represent exactly who you are and the love that you share, and for me, this is not photoshopping my images. However, if you have a breakout on your wedding day I will gladly edit that out of your images, or anything else that is not a permanent part of who you are.</p><hr><br>
							<p class="card-text card-question">Will you help us with the planning process?</p>
							<p class="card-text">I always tell THE couples that I am an unlimited resource for you, and I truly mean that! I photographed weddings almost every weekend for five years (I do about ten a year now), and I have a unique perspective on their inner workings. So I am always here to lend any advice that I can or refer you to some kick-ass vendors. Also, about two months before your wedding I will set up a phone call with you to walk through your wedding day and what time everything needs to happen, but I could always make this happen earlier if it was more helpful.</p><hr><br>
							<p class="card-text card-question">Do you offer any discounts?</p>						
							<p class="card-text">Unfortunally I do not offer any discounts as I think my price is more than reasonable.</p><hr>
