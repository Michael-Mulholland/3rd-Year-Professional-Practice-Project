# 3rd-Year-Professional-Practice-Project

## Documentation Headings

* Introduction

This repository is set up to handle our Year 3 Professional Practice in IT Project.

The two contributors for this repo will be Michael MulHolland and Kevin Flanagan.

This project has been set to show how well we can work as a team in a simulated work 
environment.

We decided after some period of discussion to build a Photographic website designed 
to handle a client's storage of their images on their special day. This Website will 
use a relational database as storage and require a Login to view their images.
